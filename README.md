fileset-muncher4
================

Interactive command line tool which can select and process file sets in bulk. 


Features
--------

- Supports 4DOS and later descript.ion file description databases. 

- Supports interactive combining of multiple regex based selection criteria for 
  both file names, paths and descriptions to pick / construct the file set you 
  wish to work on right now. (In other words: you can combine arbitrary selection
  criteria interactively using AND/OR/XOR commands.)
  
- Supports bulk rename, move, copy and, of course, delete operations.


When & Why You Want To Use This Tool
------------------------------------

If you want to process large numbers of files, some of which may be accompanied by a 
4DOS descript.ion file, but not necessarily so, you may want to give this a swing.

Use this tool to (re)organize your file assets, e.g. images.

Use this when you intend to work on large numbers of files, or when you feel a
GUI may slow you down (as none of the affordable asset management tools allow for
arbitrary regex-based interactive construction of selection sets.


Supported Platforms
------------------

- Windows (Win32/64): a MSVC10 (Microsoft Visual Studio 2010) project is provided to build the muncher4.exe tool
